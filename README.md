# FullStackApp-MathDatabase

This file will explain my FullStack application.
My application is about a Math database; the database will help the client learn about Math and present the following:

-- Learn about great mathematicians that made huge contributions to the world
-- Play a number guessing game
-- Add favorite mathematicians to the database if they don't exist already

LandingPage.html >> This file serves a landing page for our clients provide their name and get a feel for what to expect

app.html>> This file the game, the database imported information, and a section to add thoughts

app.js >> This file will have the game that the cleint will get to play as part of the database experiene. Also, the file will run the code to potentially grab something from the database 

landingPage.js >>  This file will serve as a name grabber so we can welcome the client to the database upon proceeding

MYDatabase.sql >> This holds the commands for each table created in the database

server.js >>  This file will run express and sql servers so that we can serve the info to the client




/*
Issues I ran into that percluded me from finishing the project:
   - I had to type everything in the command prompt when creating a table. It is a Windows thing and that held me back
   - My joins weren't working as well regardless of attempting different techniques
   - I had to resort to getting as much as I can done so that way I can submit on time
